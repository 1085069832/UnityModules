If you've got a suggestion for a fix for something we've missed, you're a hero! Thank you! This page is here to help make sure we can keep everything nice and tidy. UnityModules has been around for a little while, so we've got a couple of practices in place to keep track of everything.

Do note that contributions to UnityModules are subject to our [individual contributor license agreement][license-agreement]

## Fork & PR, just like standard GitHub

If you aren't familiar with this practice, check out the [GitHub guide on forking repositories][forking].

## Developer PRs should target `develop`, not `master`.

`develop` is where we put changes that have yet to be vetted by our QA team but that have been approved by the UnityModules team, so that's where you'll want to point your PR to.

## Code style

The general rule is to follow the style you observe in the document you're editing. If you're adding something new (like a large chunk of code that doesn't have an obvious existing style, or a new codefile entirely), take a quick glance at our [style guide][style-guide]. You might observe some older code that doesn't follow the current style guide (pardon our dust, we'll get to it) -- better to follow the existing style than have conflicting styles in the same document. Thanks!!
